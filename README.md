## Curriculum

Complete curriculum and chunked code for teaching (starter) JavaScript engineering through game design in the browser. The final code base is **underdesigned but digestible** by beginner students based on the following proficiency levels:
- [ ] Novice (learning syntax and computer science thinking)
- [x] **Beginner (learning app dev and engineering thinking)**
- [ ] Competent (learning algorithms and paradigm thinking)
- [ ] Proficient (learning data management and system-wide thinking)
- [ ] Expert (learning full-stack web dev and best-practices thinking)

## Requirements

* Beginner-level familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax. I've used my own curricula or Free Code Camp for this.
* Beginner-level familiarity with canvas drawing. I've used my own curricula or Code Maven for this.
* Live server. I've taught this course to young students using Glitch or Repl, which works well because learners get a live URL to share with friends.

## Description

A starter game design project using the browser; the HTML <code>canvas</code> element; and a new way of thinking about a game app. Students learn:
* Separation of concerns
* Module pattern
* Libraries
* Animation loop
* Non-vector Euler integration
* Basic collision detection
* Game design

Built with vanilla JavaScript, my favorite flavor!
